    "### Introduction\n",
    "Python Programming Language is the programming language that is most widely and mostly used in case of data and development. This paper discusses the use of Jupyter Notebook, Python and Python Basic command to write down the Python program starting from \"Hello World\" program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "The Installation python started from installing python using command \"sudo dnf install python3\", and checking version as \"python3 --version\". Then, by creating a virtual environment by using command \"python3 venv .venv\", the virtual environment was created. Then, the using pip, we installed matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy, scikit learn packages inside the virtual environment. Then, we also installed the jupyterlab, which is the notebook where we can code, execute code and create markdown files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of the Week\n",
    "On Day1, we created first hello world program. The variables declaration was discussed. The python datatypes were also discussed. The python execution of file from '.py' to the interpreter changing to the byte code '.pyc' and its syntax checking was discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Day2, we understood python syntaxes and data types. Indexing was done and f\"\" string literal was also used. On Day3, control flow statements like if...else was discussed where we can perform certain command, if the condition we stated values \"True\". \n",
    "\n",
    "On Day3, we learned about the loop statement, particularly \"while\" statement. The while statement is does iterations repetedly until and unless the conditions values \"False\". We even used conditional statements inside the loop statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Day4, the \"for\" statement is learned. It is the looping statement. It iterates over iteratable item like list or dictionaries. It also iterates over range function. In each iteration, the temporary variable stores the value in sequence. And, through it we can print it and do certain activities."
